Xnova is an open source implementation of the browser game [OGame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OGame), coded in [Python](https://www.python.org) and built on [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com). We created it with the aim of allowing anyone with a basic knowledge have a OGame server running in 5 minutes.
